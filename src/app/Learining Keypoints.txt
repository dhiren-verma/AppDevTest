Interpolation:
  Text Interpolation allows us to incorporate Dynamic String values into our HTML templates.
  By default, interpolation uses the double curly braces {{ and }} as delimiters.

Built-in Structural Directives:
  Structural Directives are responsible for HTML layout. They shape or reshape the DOM's
  structure, typically by adding, removing, and manipulating the host elements to which
  they are attached.

  * NgIf      - conditionally creates or disposes of subviewsfrom the template.
  * NgFor     - repeat a node for each item in provided list.
  * NgSwitch  - a set of directives that switch amoung alternative views.

Sharing Data between child and parent Directives and Components:
  A common pattern in angular is sharing data between a parent component and one or more
  child components. We can implement this pattern by using @Input() and @Output() directives.
